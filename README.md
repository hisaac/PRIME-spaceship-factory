# Express Challenge

This was our first time debugging someone else's code. While the errors in the code were pretty obvious, it was still a good exercise in how to read and use code we didn't write ourselves.

Rocket, The Router Rascal, has struck the spaceship factory. Per his calling card, he has only done damage to the spaceship factory's `app.js` file and files in the `routes` folder (all can be found in the `lib/server/` folder), so only make changes to those files. He couldn't help himself, and has left some punny hints behind.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork onto your computer.
2. Install the project's node dependencies by navigating to the project and running the command `npm install`
3. Run `npm test` to run the unit tests
4. When the site is back up and running, it should look like it did before. You should be able to add a new spaceship part to the list when everything is done.
